Your North American Pairs Game is Happening Soon!
=================================================

You have a reservation to play in a Unit Final game, Sunday, October 15, at the South Bay Bridge Club, 24100 Narbonne Ave., Lomita, CA.

This is a two-session Unit Final game for the North American Pairs. The first session begins at 10:00 a.m. We will take a one-hour lunch break, and should be finished around 6:00 p.m.

Important This event is at capacity!
------------------------------------

I have a waiting list of players who would like to play in this game. If you can't play Sunday as planned, or would be willing to switch to the November 5 game in Long Beach, please let me know as soon as you can!

Here is the entry information I have for you, along with a provisional table assignment:

    {pa}
    {pb}
    Flight: {flight}
    Starting table: {table} {direction}
    Request stationary: {stationary}

This table assignment may be different from your original confirmation email, as I shuffle to manage game and player requirements, and may change at game time. At this time, all pairs requesting a stationary N/S should be accommodated.
