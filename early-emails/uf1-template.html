<h1>Thank you for playing!</h1>
<p>
  Game results for Unit Final 1 have been posted online using TheCommonGame's excellent
  result merging system. They are hosted on the web host of the Pat Abbey
  Regency Bridge Club in Glendale only because that's where I have an
  affiliation with TheCommonGame.

  The game results are posted here:

  You were all very helpful and kind during the game. The South Bay Bridge Club
  is a beautiful club and well worth a visit on another occasion. I look forward
  to seeing every one of you at a bridge table soon.

    All the best,<br/>
