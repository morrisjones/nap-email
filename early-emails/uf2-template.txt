Thank you all so much for making the second Unit Final a pleasure to direct. In a few weeks I'll send notes to the qualifiers with invitations to play in the District Final in San Marino on January 14.

The Unit Final game results are available online now, with thanks to TheCommonGame and the Pat Regency Bridge Club in Glendale.

Visit http://thecommongame.com/ClubWebHost/138289/ and see the November 5, 2017 games. The "Sun Aft" sessions have overall results and qualifiers.

Best regards,
