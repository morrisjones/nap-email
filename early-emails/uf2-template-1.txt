Your North American Pairs Game is Happening Soon!
=================================================

You have a reservation to play in a Unit Final game, Sunday, November 5, at the Long Beach Bridge Center, 4782 Pacific Coast Hwy, Long Beach, CA.

This is a two-session Unit Final game for the North American Pairs. The first session begins at 10:00 a.m. We will take a one-hour lunch break, and should be finished around 6:00 p.m.

Here is the entry information I have for you, along with a provisional table assignment:

    {pa}
    {pb}
    Flight: {flight}
    Starting table: {table} {direction}
    Request stationary: {stationary}

This table assignment may be different from your original confirmation email, as I shuffle to manage game and player requirements, and may change at game time. At this time, all pairs requesting a stationary N/S should be accommodated.
