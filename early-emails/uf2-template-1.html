<h1>Your North American Pairs Game is Happening Soon!</h1>
<p>
  You have a reservation to play in a Unit Final game, Sunday, November 5,
  at the Long Beach Bridge Center, 4782 Pacific Coast Hwy, Long Beach, CA.
</p>
<p>
  This is a <i>two-session</i> Unit Final game for the North American
  Pairs. The first session begins at 10:00 a.m. We will take a one-hour
  lunch break, and should be finished around 6:00 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Here is the entry information I have for you, along with a provisional
  table assignment:
</p>
<p style="padding: 0 0 0 20px; margin-bottom: 0;">
    {pa}<br/>
    {pb}<br/>
    Flight: {flight}<br/>
    Starting table: {table} {direction}<br/>
    Request stationary: {stationary} 
</p>
<p>
  This table assignment may be different from your original confirmation email,
  as I shuffle to manage game and player requirements, and may change at
  game time. At this time, all
  pairs requesting a stationary N/S should be accommodated.
