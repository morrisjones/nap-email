    Congratulations! You have qualified to advance in District 23's
    North American Pairs competition. This is your invitation to
    compete in one of two Unit Final games, where you may qualify
    for the District Final in January. Winners at the District Final
    will represent District 23 at the North American Bridge
    Championships next spring in Philadelphia!
</p>
<p>
    You are eligible to play in one of two Unit Final games.  If
    you qualified for more than one flight, you could play in both
    Unit Finals, in a different flight for each event.  50% of the
    field will advance to the District Final in January.
</p>

    <dt><i>Unit Final 1:</i></dt>
    <dd>
        Sunday, October 15, 10:00 a.m.<br/>
        South Bay Bridge Club, Lomita, CA
    </dd>
    <dt><i>Unit Final 2:</i></dt>
    <dd>
        Sunday, November 5, 10:00 a.m.<br/>
        Long Beach Bridge Club, Long Beach, CA

<p>

    Each playoff game is two sessions with a one-hour lunch break.
    <b>Overall winners include gold points!</b> Awards are 100%
    gold for Flights A and B, and 25% gold for Flight C.

</p>
<p>

    If you qualified in multiple flights, you may choose to play
    in any flight for which you are eligible. If you are eligible
    to play in Flight C, but qualified at the club level in Flight
    B, you may play in either B or C flight during the playoffs.

</p>
<p>
    For the Unit and District finals, you may play with any partner
    who has also qualified at the previous level &mdash; but you
    must play with the same partner in Philadelphia with whom you played
    at the District Final.
