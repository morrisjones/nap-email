District 23 NAP Final Invitation
================================

Player: {fname} {lname} {pnum}
Flights: {flights_qualified}

It's almost time for the North American Pairs District Final.

The Distict Final is a two-session flighted pairs game, much like the Unit Finals in October and November.

Date      10:00 a.m., Sunday, January 14, 2018
Place     San Marino Community Center
          1800 Huntington Drive
Director  David White

There will be a one-hour break between sessions, with the second session starting at a time to be announced.

You may wish to review the Conditions of Contest at this link. http://www.bridgewebs.com//acbl23/201718NAPCOC.pdf

The top three eligible pairs in Flight A, and the top four pairs in Flights B and C will qualify to play in the national finals at the March NABC in Philadelphia. Those who qualify for participation in the national finals will be notified by the ACBL Special Events Coordinator of any subsidy their finish in the district finals may have earned.

If you qualified in multiple flights, now is the time when you must select a flight and a partner to play here and at the Nationals. Partners for the District Final must come from the pool of qualified players as seen here: https://nap.bridgemojo.com/unit-final-summary. Pairs qualifying to the national finals qualify as a pair and no new partnerships may be formed at the national finals.

Because we have room for all qualifiers, there is no need to pre-register for a seat at the district final, however I would like to know if you are not planning to play.

Please reply if you plan to withdraw from the NAP contest
