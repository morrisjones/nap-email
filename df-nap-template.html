    You may wish to review the
    <a href="http://www.bridgewebs.com//acbl23/201718NAPCOC.pdf">
    Conditions of Contest</a>
    at this link.
</p>
<p>
    The top three eligible pairs in Flight A, and the top four pairs in
    Flights B and C will qualify to play in the national finals at the
    March NABC in Philadelphia. Those who qualify for participation in
    the national finals will be notified by the ACBL Special Events
    Coordinator of any subsidy their finish in the district finals may
    have earned.
</p>
<p>
    If you qualified in multiple flights, now is the time when you
    must select a flight and a partner to play here and at the Nationals.
    Partners for the District Final must come from the pool of qualified
    players as seen here: <a href="https://nap.bridgemojo.com/unit-final-summary">
    https://nap.bridgemojo.com/unit-final-summary</a>. Pairs qualifying
    to the national finals qualify as a pair and no new partnerships may be
    formed at the national finals.
</p>
<p>
    Because we have room for all qualifiers, there is no need to pre-register
    for a seat at the district final, however I would like to know if you
    are <b>not</b> planning to play.
</p>
<h3><i>Please reply if you plan to withdraw from the NAP contest</i></h3>
<p>Thank you, and congratulations!</p>
