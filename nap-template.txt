Congratulations! You have qualified to advance in District 23's
North American Pairs competition. This is your invitation to compete
in one of two Unit Final games, where you may qualify for the
District Final in January. Winners at the District Final will
represent District 23 at the North American Bridge Championships
next spring in Philadelphia!

You are eligible to play in one of two Unit Final games.  If you
qualified for more than one flight, you could play in both Unit
Finals, in a different flight for each event.  50% of the field
will advance to the District Final in January.

    * Unit Final 1:
        Sunday, October 15, 10:00 a.m.
        South Bay Bridge Club, Lomita, CA
    * Unit Final 2:
        Sunday, November 5, 10:00 a.m.
        Long Beacn Bridge Club, Long Beach, CA

Each playoff game is two sessions with a one-hour lunch break.
Overall winners include gold points! Awards are 100% gold for Flights
A and B, and 25% gold for Flight C.

If you qualified in multiple flights, you may choose to play in any
flight for which you are eligible. If you are eligible to play in
Flight C, but qualified at the club level in Flight B, you may play
in either B or C flight during the playoffs.

For the Unit and District finals, you may play with any partner who
has also qualified at the previous level &mdash; but you must play
with the same partner in Philadelphia with whom you played at the
District Final.
