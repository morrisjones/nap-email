Congratulations! You have qualified to advance in District 23's
North American Pairs competition. This is your invitation to compete
in one of two Unit Final games, where you may qualify for the
District Final in November. Winners at the District Final will
represent District 23 at the North American Bridge Championships
next spring in Columbus!

You are eligible to play in one of two Unit Final games. If you
qualified for more than one flight, you could play in both Unit
Finals, in a different flight for each event. 60% of the field will
advance to the District Final in December.

Unit Final 1:
    Sunday, September 15, 10:00 a.m.
    Long Beach Bridge Center, Long Beach, CA 
Unit Final 2:
    Sunday, October 20, 10:00 a.m.
    San Marino Bridge Club, 1800 Hungtington Dr., San Marino 
District Final:
    Sunday, November 17, 10:00 a.m.
    South Bay Bridge Club, Lomita 

Each playoff game is two sessions with a break between sessions.
Finish time should be around 6:00 p.m. You may want to pack a lunch.

If you qualified in multiple flights, you may choose to play in any
flight for which you are eligible. If you are eligible to play in
Flight C, but qualified at the club level in Flight B, you may play
in either B or C flight during the playoffs.

For the Unit and District finals, you may play with any partner who
has also qualified at the previous level â€” but you must play with
the same partner in Philadelphia with whom you played at the District
Final.
